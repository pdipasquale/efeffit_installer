This is the Tcl interface to the Ifeffit library.

To build and install this interface: 

 1. build and INSTALL the ifeffit library.  That is, the
    ifeffit library must be installed in its final resting 
    place for the tcl extension to work properly.

    If you're building this from the standard distribution, a 
    TclSetup.in file should already be in this directory.  If 
    not (or if you are building this from the stand-alone perl
    distribution after the Ifeffit library has been installed)
    copy the TclSetup.in from the ifeffit directory:
     
     ~> cp /usr/local/share/ifeffit/TclSetup.in .
   
    (the exact location may be different, depending on how
     ifeffit was built and installed).


 2. type 'sh Build'.  
    this will simply do 
      ~> cat TclSetup.in Makefile.in > Makefile
      ~> make

    If this fails, you may want to edit the Makefile to properly 
    reflect your system's setup.

 3. test the Tcl extension:
     ~> tcl test.tcl

    If the test fails (you'll see a bunch cryptic error messages), 
    first check the 'Fortran.Notes' in the main wrapper directory.  
    If that doesn't help, please let me know.

 4. I do not know enough about tcl to know how to properly install
    a third-party extension in 'the standard way'.  If you do, please
    let me know.
