Revision history for Perl extension Ifeffit.

0.01  Tue Dec  2 23:02:37 1997
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18
1.0  Fall 1998 -- works well, using array stuff borrowed from PGPLOT

1.1  Feb 1999: removed typemap, array stuff from PGPLOT, and 
                replaced with straight XS code

1.2  Jun 1999: replace XS code with swig-generated ifeffit_wrap.c, 
               altered Ifeffit.pm to use the swig pointer mechanism.
               ifeffit_wrap.c was generated from ifeffit.i by:
                   swig -perl5 -dnone ifeffit.i 
               in the swig/ directory.  Note that this overwrites 
               Ifeffit.pm, so don't try it in the main directory!

1.3  Oct 2002: switched from swig1.1 to swig1.3.
