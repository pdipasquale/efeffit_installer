This is the Perl interface to the Ifeffit library.

To build and install this interface: 

 1. build and INSTALL the ifeffit library.  That is, the
    ifeffit library must be installed in its final resting 
    place for the perl extension to work properly.
   
    If you're building this from the standard distribution, a 
    Makefile.PL file should already be in this directory.  If 
    not (or if you are building this from the stand-alone perl
    distribution after the Ifeffit library has been installed)
    copy the Makefile.PL from the ifeffit directory:
     
     ~> cp /usr/local/share/ifeffit/Makefile.PL .
   
    (the exact location may be different, depending on how
     ifeffit was built and installed).

 2. build the Perl interface by typing 
     ~> perl Makefile.PL
     ~> make
  
    The Makefile.PL file should properly reflect your Ifeffit 
    installation, and should not require any tweaking.  If this 
    compilation fails, ask a local Perl expert or send email.

 3. test the Perl extension:
     ~> make test

    If the test fails (you'll see a bunch cryptic error messages), 
    first check the 'Fortran.Notes' in the main wrapper directory.  
    If that doesn't help, please let me know.

 4. install the perl extension:
     ~> make install
 
    You'll need write permissions to the normal Perl library, 
    which probably means you'll need to be root.

 5. The file 'ifeffit_shell.pl' is a friendly command-line interface 
    to the ifeffit library.  If the Perl Readline Module has been 
    installed, then command history and tab completion should work. 
    (If in doubt, install the GNU version of the Readline module). 
    
    You may want to install this file as 'ifeffit' somewhere in your 
    path to use instead of the standard, less-featured C version.  You
    may also want to copy (and possibly edit) the two 'run-time
    configuration' files: 
      ~> cp dot.ifeffitrc        $HOME/.ifeffitrc
      ~> cp dot.ifeffit_macros   $HOME/.ifeffit_macros

    Documentation for the Perl Module can be found by typing 
      ~> perldoc Ifeffit
    
    additional documentation about the command-line program can be 
    found by typing 'help' at the command prompt.
