This is the Python interface to the Ifeffit library.  It assumes
that you have python 1.5.2 (or later) installed on your system.

Installation instructions:

 Type 'python setup.py install' as root.

Detailed Instructions:

 1. build and INSTALL the ifeffit library.  The ifeffit library
    must be installed for the python extension to work properly. 

    If you're building this from the standard distribution, a
    site_install.py file should already be in this directory.  
 
    If not (or if you are building this after the Ifeffit library 
    has been installed) copy this files from the ifeffit directory: 
       cp /usr/local/share/ifeffit/config/site_install.py .
   
    (the exact location may be different, depending on how
     ifeffit was built and installed).
   
    Normally, you should not need to alter site_install.py, but 
    if you run into trouble, you may want to look at this file
    for hints of how it thinks Ifeffit is installed on your system.

 2. type 'python setup.py build'
    this will build the python extension for your system.  

 3. type 'python setup.py install' (do this as root) to install.

 4. If python has been installed with Tkinter capabilities (see notes
    on installing python), then gifeffit, the graphical user interface
    will be installed with the above installation.  Since gifeffit
    requires the additional Pmw widgets, these will also be installed 
    if needed.
