\section{The Basics of {\ifeffit}} \label{Ch:Basics}

{\ifeffit} is a command-based program. That is, you tell {\ifeffit} to do
something, it does that and then waits for you to tell it what to do next.
The commands that {\ifeffit} accepts are simple statements (there are no
loops or conditional statements) useful for data manipulation, and
especially for XAFS analysis.  Most commands tell {\ifeffit} to manipulate
arrays of numerical data.  There are commands for reading arrays from
files, writing arrays to files, plotting arrays, doing simple mathematical
manipulation of arrays, and more XAFS-specific commands such as
background-spline removal and Fourier transforms.  It can also fit XAFS
data using theoretical standards from {\feff} with complex modeling
abilities and automated error analysis.  This chapter gives a quick
overview of {\ifeffit} with a simple annotated example.  Much of this
material is also covered in {\IFFtut}.

\subsection{Starting the program} \label{Ch:Basics-starting} 

Typing {\tt{ifeffit}} at the system command prompt will start the basic
{\ifeffit} command-line program.  You should get a set of messages and a
command prompt that looks like this:

{\small\begin{verbatim}
  Ifeffit 1.0077  Copyright (c) 2003 Matt Newville, Univ of Chicago
                   command-shell version 1.1 with GNU Readline
  Ifeffit>
\end{verbatim}}
\noindent
At this point, you're ready to start typing {\ifeffit} commands at the
prompt.  If you don't get such a prompt, the installation on your machine
is probably corrupted. Detailed installation instructions are available
with the {\ifeffit} distribution.

\subsection{A Sample Run} \label{Ch:Basics-sample} 

We start with a fairly complete example (see the tutorial for a more gentle
introduction). Let's say you have some raw data from a beamline in a
plain-text column format, and you want to convert it to $\mu(E)$, do a
background subtraction, and then a Fourier Transform to see what the data
looks like in $R$-space.  Though a very practical request, it's really
quite a bit of data processing, so this is a fairly intense example.
Here's what the session might look like:

{\small{
%%#VerbSBox%
\begin{VerbSBox}
 Ifeffit> read_data(file=Cu.dat, type=raw, group= cu)
 Ifeffit> cu.energy  = cu.1 * 1000.0
 Ifeffit> cu.xmu     = ln(cu.2 / cu.3)
 Ifeffit> spline(energy = cu.energy, xmu = cu.xmu, 
 Ifeffit>        rbkg=1.1, kweight=1., kmin=0)
 Ifeffit> plot(cu.energy, cu.xmu)
 Ifeffit> plot(cu.energy, cu.bkg, xmin=8850, xmax=9300,  
 Ifeffit>                         color=red)
 Ifeffit> kweight = 2.0,  cu.chi_kw = cu.chi * cu.k^kweight
 Ifeffit> newplot(cu.k,  cu.chi_kw)
 Ifeffit> fftf(real = cu.chi, kmin = 2.0, kmax = 13.0, 
 Ifeffit>      dk = 1.0, kweight=2)
 Ifeffit> newplot(cu.r, cu.chir_mag, xmax=8)
 Ifeffit> $title1 = "Test: writing out  k, chi, chi*k"
 Ifeffit> $title2 = "   data from Cu.dat,   rbkg = 1.0"
 Ifeffit> write_data(file = Out.chi,  cu.k, cu.chi, 
 Ifeffit>            cu.chi_kw, $title1, $title2)
\end{VerbSBox}
%%#VerbSBox%
}}\noindent 

One important aspect of {\ifeffit} is that you can save commands into a
file and execute all commands in that file at one time.  By saving the
above commands into the file {\file{process.iff}}, we could simply type
{\tt{load process.iff}} at the {\ifeffit} command line.  These two methods
of running these commands are completely equivalent.

We'll now go through each of these lines in detail.  At times there may be
{\emph{too}} much detail here.  If so, please go through the {\textsl{The
    {\ifeffit} Tutorial}} and be patient.

\begin{verbatim}
 Ifeffit> read_data(file=Cu.dat, type=raw, group= cu)
\end{verbatim}
\noindent
This command reads in data arrays from the ASCII column file
{\file{Cu.dat}}.  The arguments {\tt{type=raw}} and {\tt{group=cu}} help
{\cmnd{read\_data()}} name the arrays it reads in.  Because arrays are often
read in and processed together, it is convenient to give them names that
are related.  Arrays names always have two parts -- a prefix and suffix,
with a dot '.' in between.  The prefix gives the group name, and the suffix
explains what the data contains.  Here, {\tt{cu}} is used as the group name
(prefix).  The type {\tt{raw}} is the simplest type, so the suffixes will
just be the column index.  To make a long story short, we just read in the
arrays {\tt{cu.1}}, {\tt{cu.2}}, and {\tt{cu.3}}.

\begin{verbatim}
 Ifeffit> cu.energy  = cu.1 * 1000.
 Ifeffit> cu.xmu     = ln(cu.2 / cu.3)
\end{verbatim}
\noindent
Presumably, we know what the contents of our data file. For this
{\file{Cu.dat}} file, the column contained energy in keV, the second
contained $I_0$ and the third $I$, for absorption data measured in
transmission.  There might have been more columns in the file, but this is
all we need at this point. {\ifeffit} prefers to think about energy in eV
not keV, so we make an array {\tt{cu.energy}} that has energy in eV, and
then we calculate $\mu(E)$ and call that {\tt{cu.xmu}}.  Note
that the math here is done on all elements of the array.

\begin{verbatim}
 Ifeffit>  spline(energy = cu.energy, xmu = cu.xmu, 
 Ifeffit>         rbkg=1.1,kweight=1.,kmin=0)
\end{verbatim}
\noindent
This computes the background spline $\mu_0(E)$ for our $\mu(E)$ using the
{\autobk} algorithm.  The argument {\tt{energy = cu.energy}} names the
array to use as the energy values, and {\tt{xmu = cu.xmu}} names the
$\mu(E)$ array.  {\tt{rbkg=1.1}} sets the value of $R_{\rm bkg}$, while
{\tt{kweight=1.}} sets the $k$-weighting, and {\tt{kmin=0}} sets the value
of $k_{\rm min}$.

Like many other commands, {\cmnd{spline}} uses, modifies, and (if necessary)
creates several arrays and scalars.  The complete list of what
{\cmnd{spline}} uses is listed in section~{\ref{Ch:Command:spline}}.  For now a
partial list will do: {\cmnd{spline}} sets the arrays {\tt{cu.bkg}} to
contain $\mu_0(E)$, {\tt{cu.k}} to contain the $k$ values, and
{\tt{cu.chi}} to contain $\chi(k)$.  Several scalar values (including
{\tt{rbkg}}, {\tt{kweight}}, {\tt{kmin}}, and {\tt{e0}}) are also set by
{\cmnd{spline}}.  You can see the values of these variables with the
{\cmnd{show}} command -- try {\tt{show(e0, kmax)}} for example.

\begin{verbatim}
 Ifeffit>  plot(cu.energy, cu.xmu)
\end{verbatim}
\noindent
This plots $\mu(E)$.  That is a plot window should appear and a trace of
$\mu(E)$ should be drawn on it.  If this does not happen, please consult
the installation instructions.  The {\cmnd{plot}} command has many optional
arguments, but here we're just giving the array names for the ordinate
{\tt{cu.energy}} and the abscissa {\tt{cu.xmu}}.

% Actually, we could have even dropped the group name in the argument.  This
% is a common feature -- When a command expects to read an array name and
% doesn't find a name with a '.' in it, it uses the name given as the suffix
% and uses the default group name (which gets set by all array-processing
% commands,  so is likely to be set already).  This means that we could have
% typed {\tt{plot(energy, xmu)}} and gotten the same plot.

\begin{verbatim}
 Ifeffit>  plot(cu.energy, cu.bkg, xmin= 8850, xmax= 9300, 
 Ifeffit>       color=red)
\end{verbatim}
\noindent
This adds a plot of $\mu_0(E)$ to the previous plot.  
We specify the x range of the
plot with {\tt{xmin = 8850, xmax = 9300}} to look at just the near-edge
region, and explicitly give the color to use for $\mu_0(E)$.  Note that
overplotting is the default behavior.  See section~{\ref{Ch:Command:plot}} for
all the plotting options, and chapter~{\ref{Ch:Plot}} for even more
information about plotting with {\ifeffit}.

\begin{verbatim}
 Ifeffit>  kweight = 2.0,  cu.chi_kw = cu.chi * cu.k^kweight
\end{verbatim}
\noindent
This sets the value of {\tt{kweight}} and uses the new value to create the
array {\tt{cu.chi\_kw}} which contains $k^2\chi(k)$.  Note that multiple
``set variable'' commands were put on a single line.

\begin{verbatim}
 Ifeffit>  newplot(cu.k,  cu.chi_kw)
\end{verbatim}
\noindent
This plots the $k$-weighted $\chi(k)$ that we just calculated.
{\cmnd{newplot}} is a variation of {\cmnd{plot}} command that reinitializes
the plot, so that it won't be plotted over the current window (which was
still showing $\mu(E)$ and $\mu_0(E)$).

\begin{verbatim}
 Ifeffit>  fftf(real = cu.chi, kmin = 2.0, kmax = 13.0, 
 Ifeffit>        dk = 1.0, kweight=2)
\end{verbatim}\noindent
This does the forward XAFS Fourier transform of $\chi(k)$.  The argument
{\tt{real = cu.chi}} tells {\cmnd{fftf}} to use {\tt{cu.chi}} (which is the
un-$k$-weighted $\chi(k)$ from {\cmnd{spline}}) as the real part of the
function to Fourier transform.  We could have said {\tt{imag = cu.chi}} to
use $\chi(k)$ as the imaginary part.  This is, to some extent, a matter of
convention -- see {\XAIBook} for more details.

The Fourier transform window was specified with the parameters {\tt{kmin}},
{\tt{kmax}}, and {\tt{dk}}.  The $k$-weight parameter for the Fourier
transform will be read from the variable {\tt{kweight}}, which we just
defined as 2.  {\cmnd{fftf}} creates arrays {\tt{cu.r}} for $R$, and
{\tt{cu.chir\_re}}, {\tt{cu.chir\_im}}, and {\tt{cu.chir\_mag}} for the
real part, imaginary part, and magnitude of $\tilde\chi(R)$, among other
things.

\begin{verbatim}
 Ifeffit>  newplot(cu.r, cu.chir_mag, xmax = 8)
\end{verbatim}\noindent
Now we plot $|\chi(R)|$, explicitly limiting the $R$-range to $8
{\rm{\AA}}$.  By default, the $R$-based arrays from {\cmnd{fftf}} will 
extend to $10 {\rm{\AA}}$.

\begin{verbatim}
 Ifeffit>  $title1 = "Test: writing out  k, chi, chi*k"
 Ifeffit>  $title2 = "   data from Cu.dat,   rbkg = 1.1"
\end{verbatim}\noindent
Here we define a pair of {\emph{text string}} variables, which always have
names starting with a dollar sign.  These are useful for doing
things like
\begin{verbatim}
 Ifeffit>  write_data(file = out.chi,  cu.k, cu.chi, 
 Ifeffit>             cu.chi_kw, $title1, $title2,e0,rbkg)
\end{verbatim}\noindent
in which we save the $\chi(k)$ and $k$-weighted $\chi(k)$ data to the file
{\file{out.chi}}.  The rest of the arguments list the arrays, text strings,
and scalars to write to the output file.  Text strings will be written
first, then the scalars, and finally the data arrays will be written, all
given in the order listed.  This ends the annotated example.


\subsection{The {\texttt{show}} and {\texttt{print}}  Commands} 
\label{Ch:Basics-show} 

Two very important commands that you definitely want to know about were
left out of the above example.  These are the {\cmnd{show}} and
{\cmnd{print}} commands, which will write out information about Program
Variables, including their values.  The {\cmnd{show}} command takes a
simple list of program variables, like this:
\begin{verbatim}
 Ifeffit>  show e0, kmin, $title1, cu.chi
\end{verbatim}\noindent
%%%-------------------------------------------------------------------------$ 
and will print something like 
\begin{verbatim} 
 e0            =  8982.315 
 kmin          =  2.000000
 $title1       = Test: writing out  k, chi, chi*k
 cu.chi        = 302 pts [ -0.3232080 : 1.233829 ]
\end{verbatim}  
%%%----------------------------------------$ 
\noindent
{\cmnd{show}} doesn't print out entire arrays but gives just enough
information (the number of points, and the minimum and maximum value) to
convince you that an array exists.  The {\cmnd{show}} command can also be
used to show all current scalars, arrays, and strings.  You can read more
about the {\cmnd{show}} command in section~{\ref{Ch:Command:show}}.

Whereas the {\cmnd{show}} command will only report about existing variables,
and will not do any processing, the {\cmnd{print}} command is a bit more
literal, printing out the {\emph{values}} of variables or expressions.
That is, {\tt{print(e0)}} will just print the numerical value of {\tt{e0}}
to the screen:
\begin{verbatim}
 Ifeffit>  print e0
      8982.315
 Ifeffit>  print "sqrt(25) + 1.001"
       6.00100
\end{verbatim}\noindent
Note that in the last example, the math expression was enclosed in double
quotes.  This (or equivalently, enclosing braces ``\{\}'') tells {\ifeffit}
to evaluate the expression, instead of printing it literally, and tells
{\ifeffit} where the expression ends.  Using single quotes would print
the expression literally:
\begin{verbatim}
 Ifeffit>  print 'sqrt(25) + 1.001 = ', "sqrt(25) + 1.001"
   sqrt(25) + 1.001 =  6.00100
\end{verbatim}\noindent
You can also {\cmnd{print}} out several expressions at once:
\begin{verbatim}
 Ifeffit>  print "sqrt(25) + 1.001", "pi / 2"
       6.001000      1.570796  
\end{verbatim}\noindent
Using {\cmnd{print}} for arrays (or an expression that gives an array) will
print all the values of the arrays:
\begin{verbatim}
 Ifeffit>  print indarr(4)/5
     0.2000000     0.4000000     0.6000000     0.8000000  
\end{verbatim}

Section~{\ref{Ch:Structure-info}} gives a more complete description of all
the ways of getting information back from {\ifeffit}.  We'll come back to
{\cmnd{show}} and {\cmnd{print}} in section~{\ref{Ch:Structure-Logging}},
where the ability to change where these outputs are printed will be
discussed.

At this point, you may find it useful to repeat the above example session
mixing in {\cmnd{show}} or {\cmnd{print}} commands after every line, and
plotting some of the other arrays.  That should give you enough of a feel
for {\ifeffit} to be able to use it for simple data processing and allow
you to use the rest of this document as a reference guide.
