\section{Examples}  \label{Ch:Examples}

Let's work through a few example scripts for common problems, using both
the simple {\ifeffit} macro system, and the more sophisticated Perl
interface.  All of the scripts described here are included in the
{\ifeffit} distribution, and are available from the {\ifeffit} web page:
{\WWWiff}.  In fact, the simpler of these examples have been put into
the form of {\ifeffit} macros {\bf{and}} perl scripts.   They may be useful
enough for you to use them without modification, but if you've made it this
far, you'll probably be comfortable altering them.
