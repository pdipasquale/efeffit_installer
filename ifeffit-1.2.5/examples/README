IFEFFIT Examples

This directory contains some simple examples of using Ifeffit for
general data analysis and especially XAFS analysis.  The examples
are organized by category and complexity, and broken into small
ifeffit scripts (all with an extension '.iff') each of which can
be run individually from the system command-line as

  ~> ifeffit help.iff

or from within the Ifeffit environment as

  ~> ifeffit

  Ifeffit> load help.iff
  
Each script contains some documentation of its own.  A brief 
description of the scripts follows:
 
  help.iff  
     Print information about these examples, test that Ifeffit
     loads, runs, and can print to the screen.

  Anomalous/calc_f1f2.iff
     calculate f' and f'' for Cu, using energy points from an
     external data file 

  Lytle/Lytle.iff
     read datafile downloaded from Farrel Lytle database, convert 
     motor steps to energy, and plot XAFS.

  Plotting/text-strings.iff
     use of text strings in plotting, especially commonly used
     greek-character constructs for XAFS spectra.

  Pre_Edge/pre.iff
     simple example of pre-edge subtraction of XAFS spectra
 
  Spline/autobk.iff
    simple example of autobk-like background subtraction of XAFS spectra

  Macros
    This directory contains several useful little macros

     Macros.iff  collection of generally useful macros, most of 
                 them reasonably well annotated
     quit.iff    simple little macro to allow 'q' to mean 'quit'
