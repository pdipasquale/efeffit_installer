    f''(E) was set to be
         f''(E)  = f''_CL(E)  for E > e0+ehigh and  E < e0-elow.
    within the range E = [e0-elow, e0+ehigh], f'' was set to
         f''(E)  = f''_CL(E) + a0 + a1 *  mu(E') * ( E' /  e0)
                 + a2 * (E' - e0) + a3 * (E' - e0)**2 
    where mu(E) was read from t.dat,
    f''_CL(E) was found for Cu, and E' = E + e0_shift.
  
    the values of e0_shift, a0, a1, a2, and a3 were determined to be:
        e0_shift =   -0.605967    
              a0 =     1.39921    
              a1 =     2.51221    
              a2 =   -0.877579E-03
              a3 =    0.125303E-05
    so as to best match f''_CL(E) between E = [e0-elow, e0+ehigh]
