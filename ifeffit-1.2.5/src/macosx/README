This directory contains OLD build instructions for ifeffit on Mac OS X.

For most Mac OS X users, a binary installer is available. For OS X 10.2 and
higher, the main source build system will work, as long as the
prerequisites liare installed.

Prerequsites:
-------------
Getting ifeffit to run on MacOS X relies heavily on the Fink Project:
   http://fink.sourceforge.net/

You will need to download the Fink base system and some of its
Unix-like extensions.  The following 'Fink packages' are needed:

 pgplot f2c g77 readline xfree86-base xfree86-rootless

(I think this is a complete list, but please let me know if I'm
missing any).  'xfree86-server' can be used instead of '-rootless',
but will not let you run XDarwin and Aqua at the same time.  Fink
strongly encourages you to install everything under the '/sw'
directory.

You will also need to install the 'Developer Tools' from the MacOS
X 'Developer Disk'.

Configuration and Build:
------------------------

Again, this is of historical interest only.

Type './configure ; make'.

This simplified version of configure takes the following options:

   --prefix=PREFIX            base directory for installation 
   --arraysize=ARRAYSIZE      tiny,small,medium,large,huge    
   --pgplot_dir=PGPLOT_DIR    directory for PGPLOT            
   --xlibs=XLIBS              link directive for X            

Type './configure --help' to get a listing of the default values (as 
these will change depending on the system).

If you installed Fink to somewhere other than '/sw', you may need to 
set '--prefix=...'.  

You may need to edit some of the top few lines of the Makefile.  

If you have troubles in this 'make' step, you might want to check 
that the file '../lib/sys.h'  exists.



Installation:
-------------
Type 'sudo make install'.

Building Extensions:
--------------------
If python is installed (say, through Fink), then the python extension
can be built as:

   cd ../../wrappers/python
   sudo python setup.py install

This should be done after Ifeffit has been installed.  This will also
install the program gifeffit.


If perl is installed, the perl extension can be built as:
   cd ../../wrappers/perl
   perl Makefile.PL
   sudo make install

If perl/Tk is installed, this should abuild and install the athena program 
as well as the perl extension.
