# This directory contains data files needed for Ifeffit to work well.
#
# directories and files contained here are:
#
# startup.iff   ifeffit startup file, loaded upon initialization.
#               this is an ideal to put site-wide macro definitions
#
# config/       files describing the ifeffit build, especially useful
#               for building extensions to ifeffit after installation.
#
# cldata/       data file needed for the f1f2() calculations of the 
#               anomalous scattering coefficients based on the work of
#               Cromer-Libermann.
