c
c    calculate a fft of a function to be minimized in either r or
c    backtransformed k-space to use as a fitting function, as in 
c    ifeffit.  calls routine xafsft which uses the routine cfftf.
c
c    ** cffti must be called prior to this routine **
c
c inputs:
c   chiq    array containing chi(q), on grid with spacing qgrid, 
c           and first point at chi(q = 0.).
c   mpts    dimension of chiq, qwin, and rwin
c   mfft    number of points to use for fft 
c   wfftc   work array for fft initialized by cffti, which must
c           be called prior to this routine.
c   qgrid   grid size for chiq.
c   qwin    q-space fft window array 
c   qweigh  q-weight in  k->r fft.
c   rwin    r-space fft window array
c   rweigh  r-weight in  r->q fft.
c   ifft    integer flag for number of fft's to do:
c             0    chifit is in original k-space 
c             1    chifit is in r-space 
c             2    chifit is in back-transformed k-space 
c   xlow    low-x range for output chifit (either r or k)
c   xhigh   high-x range for output chifit (either r or k)
c   nout    number of points in output : useful length of chifit
c outputs:
c   chifit  real array representation of the complex result from 
c           0, 1, or 2 fft of the input chi(k).
c           output between xlow and xhigh in real-imag pairs
