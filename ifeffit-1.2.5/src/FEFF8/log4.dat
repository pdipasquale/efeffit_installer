 Preparing plane wave scattering amplitudes...
 Searching for paths...
    Rmax  0.1000  keep and heap limits   0.0000000   0.0000000
    Preparing neighbor table
   Internal path finder limit exceeded -- path list may be incomplete.
    Paths found        0   (maxheap, maxscatt       1   0)
 Eliminating path degeneracies...
    Plane wave chi amplitude filter   2.50%
    Unique paths      0,  total paths       0
 Done with module 4: pathfinder.
