 Number of energy points =  78
 Doing FMS for a cluster of  55 atoms around iph =  0
 Please, wait (updates every 20 points) ...
        FMS matrix (LUD) at point  20, number of state kets = 495
        FMS matrix (LUD) at point  40, number of state kets = 495
        FMS matrix (LUD) at point  60, number of state kets = 495
 Done with module 3: FMS.
