To automatically install ifeffit, please ensure you have a stable 
internet connection, then open a terminal and navigate to this 
installer directory.

For example, if ifeffit has been downloaded to the Desktop, 
execute the console command:
```bash cd ~/Desktop/efeffit_installer/installer/```

Once inside the installer directory, run the installer.sh file 
as follows:
```bash sh installer.sh```

Please note that installation takes a long time, especially when 
installing PGPLOT -- please be patient!
